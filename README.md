Vault Project
License

Overview
The Vault project is a decentralized smart contract allowing users to deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens in a secure and controlled manner. It is designed to be easy to use by any number of users while providing administrators with essential functionalities.

Features
Deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens.
Pause and unpause functionality to control new deposits and withdrawals.
Whitelist tokens for added security.
Smart Contract Details
The main smart contract is implemented in contracts/Vault.sol. The contract is built using Solidity and is tested using Hardhat with TypeScript.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and test the project locally:

Clone the Repository:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/vault-project.git
Install Dependencies:



cd vault-project
npm install
Compile Contracts:



npx hardhat compile
Run Tests:



npx hardhat test
Ensure that all tests pass successfully.

Deploy Smart Contract:

Modify the deployment script in scripts/deploy.js with your deployment parameters, and then run:



npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
Interact with the Contract:

Use the contract address deployed in the previous step to interact with the smart contract. Update the Vault address in the test script if needed.

Usage
Provide instructions on how users and administrators can interact with the smart contract. Include examples of depositing, withdrawing, pausing, and whitelisting tokens.

typescript

// Example usage in TypeScript test script
await vault.connect(owner).whitelistToken(token.address);
await vault.connect(user).deposit(token.address, parseEther('100'));
await vault.connect(user).withdraw(token.address, parseEther('50'));
