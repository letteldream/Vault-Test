# Vault Project

## Overview
  
The Vault project is a decentralized smart contract allowing users to deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens in a secure and controlled manner.
It is designed to be easy to use by any number of users while providing administrators with essential functionalities.
  
## Features

- Deposit and withdraw ERC-20 tokens.
- Pause and unpause functionality to control new deposits and withdrawals.
- Whitelist tokens for added security</li>
  
## Smart Contract Details
  
The main smart contract is implemented in contracts/Vault.sol .
The contract is built using Solidity and is tested using Hardhat with TypeScript.
  
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and test the project locally:
  
1. Clone the Repository:
     
```sh
git clone https://github.com/letteldream/vault-project.git
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Compile Contracts:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Run Tests:

```sh
npx hardhat test
```

5. Deploy Smart Contract:
        
Modify the deployment script in scripts/deploy.js with your deployment parameters, and then run:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

6. Interact with the Contract:

Use the contract address deployed in the previous step to interact with
the smart contract. Update the Vault address in the test
script if needed.

## Usage
  
Provide instructions on how users and administrators can interact with the
smart contract. Include examples of depositing, withdrawing, pausing, and
whitelisting tokens.

```
await vault.connect(owner).addToWhiteList(token.address);
await vault.connect(user).deposit(token.address, parseEther('100'));
await vault.connect(user).withdraw(token.address, parseEther('50'));
```
